# Lab_OOP_0

1. I installed Ubuntu and an app Rufus and I created a bootable USB. Then I used the USB to install Ubuntu following the instalation process. So, I got
Ubuntu, here I am.
2. Using the terminal command "sudo apt install zsh" I installed zsh. After that I used another command "chsh -s /bin/zsh" to make zsh my primary shell.
with cocmmand "sudo apt-get install git curl" and with a long link I installed oh-my-zsh.
