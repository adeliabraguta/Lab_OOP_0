# Lab_OOP_0

1. I installed Ubuntu and an app Rufus and I created a bootable USB. Then I used the USB to install Ubuntu following the instalation process. So, I got
Ubuntu, here I am.
2. Using the terminal command "sudo apt install zsh" I installed zsh. After that I used another command "chsh -s /bin/zsh" to make zsh my primary shell.
with cocmmand "sudo apt-get install git curl" and with a long link I installed oh-my-zsh.
The command "sudo apt-get install git" installed git on my PC.
Commands "sudo apt install build-essential" and "sudo apt-get install manpages-dev" are for installing gcc compiler.
Also I installed Visual Studio Code.
3. "mkdir" is to create a new directory. In that directory I wrote "git innit" to initialize a git project. Command "nano" opens the compiler gcc in the terminal,
there I wrote the "Hello World" program in C and saved it with "gcc hello.c -o hello" command. Typing "./hello" displayed our C program in the terminal. Then using "nano Makefile" I opened the new compiler where we wrote the makefile program and after exiting the terminal I used "make" to save the file and with "./a.out" we made a functional C program. After adding all the screenshots on the directory I used "git add ." to add all files to stageing and with "git commit" I commited the files.
after setting up the repository on GitHub and linking it with terminal I was able to use "git push" to push all the files on GitHub.
4. After THAT I wrote all of this in README.md. Thank you!
